![Greeting](project-java-spring-tjastrz/images/greeting.png)

#### Worth noting

The folder structure is actually:

![Static1](project-java-spring-tjastrz/images/static1.png)

However, in the IDE resources folder shows "static.images", which may be misleading. Please keep that in mind. 

![Static2](project-java-spring-tjastrz/images/static2.png)
